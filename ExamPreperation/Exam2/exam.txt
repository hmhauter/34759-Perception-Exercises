Question 18 (6.0% of the test grade): - Numerical - Stereo Calibration
One property of stereo rectiﬁed images is that epipolar lines are parallel, and that
the points on an epipolar line in one image plane can be found on the
corresponding epipolar line in the other image plane. Therefore, it is necessary to
know the equation for the epipolar in order to optimize the performance of any later
template matching.
Determine the approximate coeﬃcients of the epipolar lines in the
imageset left.png and right.png by taking the average of all the epipolar lines.
You should use 2000 of the best matching sift keypoints to compute the epipolar
lines.
